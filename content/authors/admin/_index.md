I received my B.Sc. degree from Nanjing University, in June 2021. In the same year, I was admitted to study for a Ph.D. degree in Nanjing University without entrance examination in the [LAMDA](http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/) Group led by professor Zhi-Hua Zhou, under the supervision of Prof. De-Chuan Zhan.
